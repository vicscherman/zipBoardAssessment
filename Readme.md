FakeBook is a simple messageboard app built with the Meteor framework. It has a couple key features

1. It allows you to either log in an existing user or register a new one. This is required to access the messageboard.
2. Once you're logged in, you can view all messages. They are listed in chronological order, with earlier posts appearing towards the bottom of the page.
3. You can always delete your own posts, however, you cannot delete the posts of other users.
4. A couple of UI features depending on who is logged in. You'll see the logged in user name change, and your own messages will have the posted by name printed out as "me"
5. If you forget who you are, just look at the top right corner of the screen! You can also log out there.
